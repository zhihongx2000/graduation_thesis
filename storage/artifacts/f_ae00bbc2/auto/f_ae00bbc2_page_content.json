Cyber security is known as information technology security,which secures the network from attackers [6].It consists of a multi-layer that provides secure energy acquiring between the smart meter and home network.If the attacker hacks the home network,the smart home's energy is modified [7].In this case,continuous energy monitoring is necessary.This periodic monitoring detects the vulnerability in the network and secures the home network from hacking [8]. Here the prediction is derived to find the attackers and resolves the issue from hacking.By processing this prediction method, the security loss is reduced,whereas it improves the system's performance [9]. They are many approaches used to detect the attack in the network and protect the system.Cyber security is based on an authentication process in which the legitimate user accesses the smart meter; thus,the security of the smart home is maintained [1O]. It makes sense to provide security features by advancing intelligent technology.The user may monitor the alarm arming and disarming and edit certain alarm settings,such as the key code.Here the user may configure remote monitoring settings.It would operate first by detecting movement in outside lights.Using electronic sensors connected to the device,the security staff or homeowner would be forced to open any window or door.In fires,break-ins, orany other disasters,conventional home security systems warn authorities that automated housing is more secure.Many smart home monitoring systems will submit intelligent notices that separate welcome guests from foreign guests.The best thing is an integrated home safety system,which is entirely adjustable to your unique security specifications as part of your home automation installation.

Besides lighting, home components that can automate and monitor smart home apps include heating and air conditioning, entertainment systems, doors or windows,windows,protection systems,water sprinkling,and appliances.However,smart home applications can track devices and environments with the necessary sensors and give a warning when a problem occurs.The energy efficiency is resolved by improving the security level in-home network in which the necessary energy is provided to the devices [12].In this manner,the photovoltaic (PV) device offers more energy efficiency in smart home based on solar energy [13]. The energy consumption increases the lifetime of the appliances processed based on the cyber security method [14]. Smart homes use devices that can attach to the internet and contain small computers that allow them to be operated remotely. Second, it can't be safe for individual devices. Some home IoT devices are swiftly placed on the market and may not have addressed their protection adequately.In certain situations,user manuals don't discuss privacy issues or include adequate details to ensure that the system is secure.For example,baby screens and safety cameras have been hacked,allowing offenders to see inside a home. Even if the intelligent home has some security issues,it can build opportunities for a safer home.While most devices aim to simplify your life, some may provide smart home safety and security. ",

The biggest engine for smart and sustainable urban planning is reducing the carbon footprint.The greatest benefits include enhancing energy efficiency, storage，and waste management，and traffic conditions.Repeating concepts of smart cities are smart grids and smart water management. Heating and cooling systems are very similar in energy waste.Perhaps you have left appliances or lights in the house,and you remember that when you come home from work or even on holidays.People do not have to be worried about these kinds of the problem if you can manage anything right from a smartphone.The bank account and your wallet are stronger. One of the main advantages of this form of technology is that it does not worry much about being forgetful. Smart homes are a growing development that helps improve the environment (see Fig.15). ",
